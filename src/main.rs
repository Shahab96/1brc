/* Flip this around to see performance differences on different machines
 * Don't go too high! You'll start getting pointer overlap problems!
 * Use 1 to evenly distribute the data across your cores.
 *
 * This is a constant, so the compiler will optimize it out
 * However, know that as you decrease this number, you will have threads that finish and
 * simply spin down. So as you continue to process your chunks a lot of cpu time is wasted.
 * It's useful to increase this and check what the best value is for your machine.
 *
 * As you increase this value, the chunks will be smaller, and the threads will finish faster.
 * However since you are using more threads than the number of cores you have, it is very likely
 * that one of your cores will simply grab a thread from the cpu scheduler and dedicate itself to that.
 * This means that you will overall waste less cpu time, however if you end up processing faster
 * than you read, then you will still be bottlenecked by IO.
